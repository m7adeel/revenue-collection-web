# User Stories

## System Administrator Stories

### User Management
- As an Administrator, I want to be able to perform all actions available to a Tax Collector so that I can understand and support their workflows.
- As an Administrator, I want to create new user accounts for tax collectors and other administrators so that I can manage system access.
- As an Administrator, I want to modify existing user account details (e.g., roles, permissions) to maintain accurate user profiles.
- As an Administrator, I can only deactivate user accounts instead of permanently deleting them, to preserve audit trails.

### Data Management
- As an Administrator, I want to delete most records (excluding user accounts, payment history, and login history) to manage data and system cleanliness.

### Reporting and Analytics
- As an Administrator, I want to generate reports and view dashboards on collection data, user activity, and system performance for analysis and decision-making.

## System Stories

### Audit Trail Management
- As the System, I want to automatically record the creator, creation date, last modifier, and last modification date for all newly created records to maintain an audit trail.
- As the System, I want to automatically update the last modified by and last modified date fields whenever any record is updated to track changes.

### Payment Tracking
- As the System, I want to specifically track the Payer, amount, payment type, and status in the payment history table for detailed payment tracking.

### Security Monitoring
- As the System, I want to capture all login attempts and their outcomes (success/failure) in a login history log for security monitoring.
